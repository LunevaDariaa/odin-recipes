            <li>cold drinking water - 180 ml</li>
            <li>egg - 1 pc.</li>

        <h3>STEP-BY-STEP RECIPE</h3>
        <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dumpling batter. Pour the water into a bowl. Add the egg and salt, then whisk together with a whisk. Sift the flour onto the table in a mound and make a well on top.</li>
            <li>Pour the water and egg into the flour and mix gently to form a firm dough. Form it into a ball, wrap it in clingfilm and leave it for 20 minutes. Then knead the dough again and leave for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cherries for the dumplings. Wash the fruit and dry it on a paper towel. Remove the pips. Put the cherries in a bowl, cover with sugar and leave for 30 minutes. Discard in a sieve and collect the juice.</li>
            <li>Separate a portion of the dumpling dough and roll out into a layer about 2mm thick. Cut out circles with a thin glass or a notch. Place 4-5 cherries on each one. Tape the edges of the dough firmly together to form a braid.</li>
            <li>Place the dumplings on a board dusted with flour. Gather dough scraps into a lump: after 15-20 minutes it can be rolled out again. Make dumplings from all the remaining dough in this way.</li>
            <li>Pour about 2/3 of the water into a three-liter saucepan and bring to a boil. Gently lower the dumplings into it and stir to prevent them from sticking to the bottom. After the water boils again and the dumplings float, cook them for 3-4 minutes.</li>
