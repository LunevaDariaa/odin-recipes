     <h3>STEP-BY-STEP RECIPE</h3>
     <div class="steps">
     <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Boil the broth.Pour cold water into a saucepan, place the meat and put it on medium heat. The broth will taste better if you use meat on the bone.When the liquid boils, cover the pot with a lid and cook on low heat for an hour and a half.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make a stir-fry.
            Wash and peel beets, carrots and onions. Grate the beets on a coarse grater and the carrots on a medium grater. Cut the onion into small cubes.
            
            Pour oil into a skillet, turn on medium heat. Fry the onions and carrots, stirring, for about 5 minutes.
            
            Then put out the beets. Add to it citric acid, vinegar or lemon juice. Thanks to this borscht will be really red and will acquire a pleasant sourness.
            
            
            Cook the roast for another 5 minutes. After that, add tomato paste, stir and leave on the fire for another 5-7 minutes.
            
            </li>
        <li>
            Step 3: Assemble the borscht.
            When the broth has boiled, remove the meat from it. While it cools, pour the shredded cabbage into the pot. After 5-10 minutes, add potatoes cut into straws or cubes.
            
            You can change the order in which the vegetables are put in. If the cabbage is young, it is better to add it after the potatoes. Or at the same time, if your potatoes boil quickly.
            
            
            While the potatoes are boiling, separate the meat from the bone and cut into cubes. Return it to the soup. Salt to taste.
            
            
            Add the roast and stir.
            
            
            Throw in the bay leaf and finely chopped herbs. Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for another 5-7 minutes.
            
            
            
            For flavor, you can add some crushed garlic, ground cloves or black pepper to the pot. Leave the borscht under the lid to infuse for 5-10 minutes.</li>
